Users should be able to:

- Any input field is empty or are in the wrong format

### What I learned
I am proud of my solution, it is very similar to the original design and the functionalities work perfectly, I focused on optimizing the code to make it efficient. I attach a part in which in an object included validations and data that I will call in the functions to achieve the optimal performance of each one, using listening events to give results in real time.
